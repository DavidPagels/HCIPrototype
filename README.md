# HCI Prototype
####David Pagels, David Donatucci, Thomas Harren
*A protoype for our Spring 2015 Human Computer Interation class.*


This project is the android app we spun up in a few weeks to mock-up our user interface and take a swing at our purposed functionality. 
The idea for this project is to design an app that will take a user's geographical location into account in order to tell the user how quickly they must move to get to their next appointment on time.
